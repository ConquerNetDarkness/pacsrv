The script on the website is used to help client find some other nodes 
on the network to start communicating and build up an internal server 
list.

This script will try to be as simple as possible, and use the least 
amount of resources as possible.

The script will basically do this.

1.  Receive request from client to get an IP.  Client will pass a 
parameter which is the port it listens on.

2.  Site will look in its network.txt file, randomly choose 3 entries in 
that file, and send them back to the client.

3.  Site will add that client's IP and port (that was supplied) to the 
network-next.txt file

4.  Every 5 minutes, a cron job will run which very simply removes the 
network.txt file, and then renames the network-next.txt file after first 
removing any duplicate entries.  

5.  That is all.
