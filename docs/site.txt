The script on the website is used to help client find some other nodes 
on the network to start communicating and build up an internal server 
list.

This script will try to be as simple as possible, and use the least 
amount of resources as possible.

The script will basically do this.

1.  Receive request from client to get an IP.  Client will pass a 
parameter which is the port it listens on.

2.  Site will look in its network.txt file, randomly choose 3 entries in 
that file, and send them back to the client.

3.  Site will add that client's IP and port (that was supplied) to the 
network-next.txt file

4.  Every 5 minutes, a cron job will run which very simply removes the 
network.txt file, and then renames the network-next.txt file after first 
removing any duplicate entries.  

5.  That is all.




------------------------------
For ease of use, the IP/port details will be stored in a MySQL table.  it will be of the following schema.

CREATE TABLE Locations (
  LocID   INT UNSIGNED UNIQUE AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
  IP      INT UNSIGNED,
  Port    INT,
  Created DATETIME,
  Status  TINYINT DEFAULT 0,
  PRIMARY KEY(LocID)
);

When a query is made, the details are added to the table, if that IP is not already in the table.  It will return the oldest 3 records, and remove the very oldest (as long as we have more than 3 records in the table).  This should all be done in a LOCK TABLE setting to keep it consistant.

Even though we are returning 3 addresses, we will be adding one for every one that is being removed, so we should maintain a very small list, with each address being given out 3 times.   

Every hour, we could do a cron job that checks this table to see
