Pacsrv Communications Protocol.

This is version 2 of the protocol and we are now using a RISC based 
protocol.  It is a simple binary protocol made up of commands that are 
used in combination to form a single operation.  Commands can have a 
single parameter (or none at all) and the operation doesnt execute until 
the GO command is received.

All operations are stateless.  This means that the server and client cannot assume that 
you know what it is talking about.  However, the received paramters are NOT cleared 
unless a CLEAR is received.   This means that a node can re-use information that is 
already sent.


The command is a single byte.   The parameters are based on the

Process Flows

We have several classes of service.   We have a client/server relationship, and also a 
server/server relationship.   To keep things simple, we will call the server/server 
relationship a node/node relationship.  

When a client connects to a server, it is solely to get a required file.

	CLEAR
	FILENAME <filename-pkg.tar.gz>
	GET
	EXECUTE

If the server has the file, it will respond with:

	CLEAR
	FILENAME <filename-pkg.tar.gz>
	EXISTS
	LENGTH <length>
	EXECUTE

If the server doesn't have the file, it will first respond with:

	CLEAR
	SEARCHING
	EXECUTE

It will then queue requests to all the connected nodes, asking them if they have the 
file.

	CLEAR
	SEARCH
	TTL <15>
	FILENAME "filename-pkg.tar.gz"
	PATH "ip:port"
	EXECUTE

Each node that received the SEARCH request, will pass on the search request to all nodes 
that it has connected, IF the TTL is not zero, and the connected nodes are not already 
in the PATH list.  The TTL number will be reduced by 1, and this servers ip and port 
will be added to the path.

	CLEAR
	SEARCH
	TTL <14>
	FILENAME "filename-pkg.tar.gz"
	PATH "ip:port,ip:port"
	EXECUTE

At the same time, it will look in its own file list, and partially downloaded files, and 
if it has the file.   If it has a visible port on the internet it will reply with:

	CLEAR
	FOUND
	FILENAME "filename-pkg.tar.gz"
	TARGET "ip:port"
	PATH "ip:port" 
	EXECUTE

The reply will get re-transmitted back along the PATH that was supplied, each server 
will remove its own IP address from the path, and pass it to the next.  When it gets to 
the originating server, it will connect to the TARGET address.   

If the server doesn't have a visible port on the internet (determined based on startup 
options), it will instead connect to the first ip:port in the PATH and will simply try 
to connect directly with the server that made the request.   This will allow the system 
to handle both sides of a NAT.

Once a server has received a FOUND operation for a file that it is looking for, it will 
start asking for chunks that it needs.   

	CLEAR
	FILENAME "filename-pkg.tar.gz"
	GET_CHUNK
	CHUNK_ID <0x00000000>
	EXECUTE
	CHUNK_ID <0x00000001>
	EXECUTE
	CHUNK_ID <0x00000002>
	EXECUTE

The server or node will send each chunk as requested.

	CLEAR
	SEND_CHUNK
	FILENAME "filename-pkg.tar.gz"
	CHUNK_ID <45>
	LENGTH <16384>
	DATA <...data...>
	EXECUTE
	CHUNK_ID <46>
	DATA <...data...>
	EXECUTE
	CHUNK_ID <47>
	DATA <...data...>
	EXECUTE

When the server receives chunks for a file that a connected client is waiting on, it 
will need to send it back.   

After the last chunk is received, the client will close the connection with the server.  
The server will not close the connection unless the heartbeats fail.

Heartbeats are merely a NO-OP every 5 seconds or so.  If the server doesnt receive 
anything within 30 seconds, it closes the connection.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Network/Node protocol will be a bit more complex.

It is a simple text based protocol with fixed-length binary fields.

All messages are singular, and not necessarily confirmation based.  This means that the message can be sent or received at almost any time.  

Only one file transfer can be done per node at a time, but file requests can still be received, and be passed on.   If the node has the file, it will be stored in a queue of files to transfer, and after the current file is completed, it will attempt to connect to the node and send the file.  If the node has already received the file, it wont have any chunks to request, so the connection will close, and the server can try to send the next file in the list.

The file will be send over the network in chunks of 32kb.  Basically when a client asks its daemon for a file. The daemon will send a File Request (F) to all the nodes that are actively connected to that daemon.  Those nodes will send the request on to all other nodes, and so on.   Any node that has the file, will send a File Notice (N) back to the daemon to say that it has the file.  The daemon will then connect to that node directly, and first initiate a download of the file, and then request chunks of the file.  It will do that for all the nodes that reply.

The File Request telegram will also contain a node-path so that the reply can be routed back to the originating deamon.  This is required, because we want the daemon to be the one to connect to the node, rather than the other way round, we dont want to allow the system to be used to trick a node into connecting to a system that it shouldn't although this is still possible, but a bit more restrictive.  Also, we want people behind NAT's and firewalls to still be able to download even if they cant contribute to the network.

When a new node connection is made with the daemon, it first ensures the initialisation, and then sends the Server list telegram to the connection.  It then will go thru its list of outstanding files asking the connection if it has each one.  If the connection does, then it will start asking for chunks that it hasnt received yet.  When the file list is completed, it will not ask any more and will just let the connection go idle.

Chunk downloading will be a bit complicated, and will be handled by the actual Network object.  It will go thru the list of filenames we need to download, and will ask each node to download it.  If the node has already asked, and is downloading that file, it will ask for the chunk.  If the node is not in a state to ask for that file, then it will not do it.


INITIALISATION
    -->  I<ver><port*2>
    <--  V          -- version ok.
    <--  Q          -- version not ok.

    The connecting node will send this telegram when it first connects.  We cannot communicate if we dont have the same protocol.  If all is good, server sends back a V telegram.  If not, then server sends Q and then closes the connection.   If we ever end up with a need for more than 254 versions, the 0xff version number can be used to indicate that the next field is an extra version field, and this could go on forever.... of course, it is highly unlikely that we would end up with so many protocol changes that we run into this problem.
    
SERVER LIST
    -->  S<server*4><port*2>

    After INIT, the server will send to the client an address of another server on the network and then will initiate a 5 minute timer to repeat the process.   Eventually all the nodes will be able to know about all the other nodes, so it can re-connect if it needs to.  This will happen even if the node is only connecting to get a file (so maybe we can set an initial timer of 5 or 10 seconds or something to see what the node is intending to do, or we can include a flag in the INIT hand-shake).

PING
    -->  P
    <--  R
    
    We will want to keep our network connections active, so a PING will be sent every 5 seconds.  A P or an R telegram will reset the heartbeat timeout counter, so you could really just send out R's all the time and keep the connection open if you dont want a reply.  However, at some point the software will be trying to make the network more efficient and localised by nodes based on network latency (so all nodes for a particular country would tend to be grouped together rather than randomly connected to nodes all over the planet).  During normal operations both nodes in the connection will be sending P/R messages back and forth if no actual data is being transferred.    We could use a simple keep-alive system instead, but then we wouldnt have the opportunity for the network latency testing.
    
FILE REQUEST 
    -->  F<hops><ttl><flen><file*flen><host*6>...<host*6>
    <--  G<hops><flen><file*flen><target*6><host*6>...<host*6>
    
    The server, when it receives an 'F', checks to see if it has the file.  If it does, it returns the message back to the node it was received from, almost identicle to what it received (except it has an added <target> parameter.  That node will trim off its details and resend the message to the last host in the list (assuming it is still a client of that node).  The reply message should eventually get back to the daemon that actually made the request.  The host and target parameters are 6 byte ip and port values.  the port being the last two bytes.   The File request is modified to include the current node, and is passed on to all other nodes that arent already in this list.
    
    The reason that we actually send the G message back thru the network is because we want the requesting node to actually be the one that makes connections to the nodes that have the file.
      
    If a G message is sent back, we still want to pass the request on to the rest of the networks, but only those that have not been listed in the message path already.  The entire network (ttl levels deep) should respond with details about getting that file, not just the first one that happens to have it.

LOCAL FILE REQUEST
    -->  L<flen><file*flen>
    <--  A<flen><length*4><file*flen>
    <--  N<flen><file*flen>
    
    When the daemon has sent a file request and received connection information about a node that has the file, the daemon will send the (L) telegram.  Actually, every time we connect to another node, we will send a request for all the files that we are trying to fulfull.   If the node has the file, it will return an (A) telegram.  If it doesnt have the file it will send an (N) telegram.  If we connect to a server we will send this command immediately after all initialisation is done.   If the node connected to us, we will wait 2 seconds and then ask them for any file that we have a need for.

CHUNK REQUEST
    -->  C<chunk*2>
    <--  D<chunk*2><len*2><data*len>
    
    This telegram is only allowed after a successful (L) telegram.  If we send a (C) telegram when it is not appropriate, the node will terminate the connection with us.  The D telegram can only reply to a chunk that we have asked for.   We could actually improve performance of this, because we could provide a list of chunks instead of just one.  The problem with this is, how do we know this connection is the fastest.  The system will not wait for the chunk to finish before asking other nodes for the other chunks we need.  Therefore, even if one of the nodes is very slow, it still should be able to transfer the 32kb of data in a reasonable time.
    
    It is assumed that we will be able to keep stats on the performance of each node, and therefore we will know which ones provide good performance, and therefore which ones to ask, but since most of the packages we will be downloading will likely be a few megs, I dont know if we will be able to get enough stats to make a difference.
    
    The fact that we will be asking chunks from a large number of connections, the aggregate download should get pretty high as we will ask chunks from the nodes as quickly as we can.
    
LOCAL FILE COMPLETE
    -->  K
    
    This lets the node know that we have completed all requests for that file.  Even if we have another file request we must send this telegram first.
